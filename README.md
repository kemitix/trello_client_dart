# Trello Client for Dart

- trello_client_dart

Status: experimental/alpha/development

Developing a client library for interacting with Trello API. Includes a command line tool to exercise and test the client library that will provide *some* functionality as a simple Trello Client in itself. Ultimately these should be broken into two packages - when I figure out how to do that, but it's not a priority.

## Test Drive

```bash
$ dart run bin/trello_client.dart $TRELLO_USERNAME $TRELLO_KEY $TRELLO_TOKEN 
```
